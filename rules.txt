What are the rules of badminton?

The exact rules of badminton have changed over time, but the aim is to land the shuttle in-bounds in the opponent's half of the court without the opponent returning it successfully. Matches are currently played to a best-of-three games, with the first to 21 points winning each game. Each player or doubles team must win each game by two clear points, except if a game reaches 29â€“all, a single sudden-death point is played.
