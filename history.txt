By whom, where and when was Badminton invented?

In 1873, the Duke is credited with bringing a version of the game—Poona—back from India and introducing it to his guests.

The sport quickly grew in popularity, and in 1877, the first set of written rules were devised by the newly formed Bath Badminton Club. The Badminton Federation of England was created 16 years later, and in 1899, it organised the first All England Championships.
